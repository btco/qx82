# QX82
QX82 is a tiny Javascript engine that lets you create games and experiences inspired by the look and feel of a retro 80s computer. It's not an emulator or a fantasy console: it's just a Javascript library. It's free and open source.

For more information, check out the
[QX82 site](https://btco.github.io/qx82).
